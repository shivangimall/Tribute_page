    <p>We can say without sembalance of doubt that she was a woman who had an interesting life. She was curious, intelligent and talented. She travelled and changed residence many times from young age . She was the first to do many things on big screen when films where still made in black and white: she was a star.But she also had great and resourceful mind, that made her learn from everything available around her; she did experiment and made invention. One of which is very present in our daily life nowdays. Hedy Lamarr, the star MGM called “the most beautiful woman in the world”, had two of the worst-kept secrets in Hollywood. One of them, she could never escape until long after her career was over. The other, the press took little interest in at the time – but since her death in 2000, this is the story that has come to define her. A new documentary about Lamarr’s life, released this weekend, encapsulates both stories – one about sex and the other about science – in the innuendo of its title: Bombshell. Lamarr’s story is one of a brilliant woman who was consistently underestimated.Although she achieved international fame as a Hollywood movie star, Lamarr was not satisfied by acting.</p>
